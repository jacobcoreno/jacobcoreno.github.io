  abstract={Drafts are sequential allocation procedures for distributing heterogeneous and indivisible objects among agents subject to some priority order (e.g., allocating players' contract rights to teams in professional sports leagues). Agents report ordinal preferences over objects and bundles are partially ordered by pairwise comparison. We provide a simple characterization of draft rules: they are the only allocation rules which are respectful of a priority (RP), envy-free up to one object (EF1), non-wasteful (NW) and resource monotonic (RM). RP and EF1 are crucial for competitive balance in sports leagues. We also prove three related impossibility theorems showing that the competitive-balance axioms RP and EF1 are generally incompatible with strategy-proofness. However, draft rules satisfy maxmin strategy-proofness. If agents may declare some objects unacceptable, then draft rules are characterized by RP, EF1, NW, and RM, in conjunction with individual rationality and truncation invariance. In a model with variable populations, draft rules are characterized by EF1, EFF, and RM, together with (population) consistency, top-object consistency, and neutrality.},

  title={Some Characterizations of TTC in Multiple-Object Reallocation Problems},
  author={Coreno, Jacob and Feng, Di},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.04822},
  year={2024},
  abstract={This paper considers exchange of indivisible objects when agents are endowed with and can consume any bundles. We focus on efficient allocation rules that satisfy a novel participation requirement, the weak endowment lower bound, and which defend against simple manipulation heuristics: drop strategies and truncation strategies. Based on these properties, we obtain characterizations of a generalized version of Top Trading Cycles (TTC) on several domains. On the lexicographic and conditionally lexicographic domains, TTC is characterized by Pareto efficiency, balancedness, the weak endowment lower bound, and truncation proofness (or drop strategy-proofness). On the domain of responsive preferences, similar characterizations are obtained by restricting attention to rules that are “individual-good-based” and weakening Pareto efficiency to individual-good efficiency. For the Shapley-Scarf model, TTC is characterized by Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and truncationproofness. The lexicographic and conditionally lexicographic domains are maximal domains on which Pareto efficiency coincides with individual-good efficiency.},
