      abstract={In the object reallocation problem introduced by Shapley and Scarf (1974), Fujinaka and Wakayama (2018) showed that Top Trading Cycles (TTC) is the unique rule satisfying individual rationality, strategy-proofness, and endowments-swapping-proofness. We show that the uniqueness remains true if strategy-proofness is weakened to truncation-proofness.},
