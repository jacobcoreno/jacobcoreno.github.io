Drafts are sequential allocation procedures for distributing heterogeneous and indivisible objects among agents subject to some priority order (e.g., allocating players’ contract rights to teams in professional sports leagues). Agents reveal ordinal preferences over objects and bundles are partially ordered by pairwise comparison. We provide a simple characterization of *draft rules*: they are the only allocation rules satisfying *respectfulness of a priority (RP)*, *envy-freeness up to one object (EF1)*, *non-wastefulness (NW)* and *resource-monotonicity (RM)*. RP and EF1 are crucial for competitive balance in sports leagues. We also prove three related impossibility theorems: (i) *weak strategy-proofness (WSP)* is incompatible with RP, EF1, and NW; (ii) WSP is incompatible with EF1 and *(Pareto) efficiency (EFF)*; and (iii) when there are two agents, *strategy-proofness (SP)* is incompatible with EF1 and NW. However, draft rules satisfy the competitive-balance properties, RP and EF1, together with EFF and *maxmin strategy-proofness*. Intuitively, draft rules are strategy-proof when agents face uncertainty about other agents’ preference reports and they are maxmin utility maximizers. If agents may declare some objects unacceptable, then draft rules are characterized by RP, EF1, NW, and RM, together with *individual rationality* and *truncation-invariance*.
