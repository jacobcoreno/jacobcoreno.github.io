### Some Characterizations of TTC in Multiple-Object Exchange Problems
[Download PDF](https://jacobcoreno.github.io/docs/Some_Characterizations_of_TTC_WP_24-04-07.pdf)

This paper considers exchange of indivisible objects when agents are endowed with and desire bundles of objects. Agents are assumed to have lexicographic preferences over bundles. We show that Top Trading Cycles (TTC) is characterized by efficiency, the weak endowment lower bound, balancedness, and truncation-proofness. In the classic Shapley–Scarf Economy, TTC is characterized by efficiency, individual rationality, and truncation-proofness. These results strengthen the uniqueness results of Ma (1994) and, more recently, Altuntaş et al. (2023). In a model with variable endowments, TTC is susceptible to various forms of endowment manipulation. However, no rule is core-selecting and hiding-proof.

Drafts are sequential allocation procedures for distributing heterogeneous and indivisible objects among agents subject to some priority order (e.g., allocating players' contract rights to teams in professional sports leagues). Agents report ordinal preferences over objects and bundles are partially ordered by pairwise comparison. We provide a simple characterization of draft rules: they are the only allocation rules which are _respectful of a priority (RP)_, _envy-free up to one object (EF1)_, _non-wasteful (NW)_ and _resource monotonic (RM)_. RP and EF1 are crucial for competitive balance in sports leagues. We also prove three related impossibility theorems showing that the competitive-balance axioms RP and EF1 are generally incompatible with _strategy-proofness_. However, draft rules satisfy _maxmin strategy-proofness_. If agents may declare some objects unacceptable, then draft rules are characterized by RP, EF1, NW, and RM, in conjunction with _individual rationality_ and _truncation invariance_. In a model with variable populations, draft rules are characterized by EF1, EFF, and RM, together with _(population) consistency_, _top-object consistency_, and _neutrality_.
