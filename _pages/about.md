I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at The University of Melbourne, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Ivan Balbuzanov](https://sites.google.com/site/ibalbuzanov/home) and [Alex Nichifor](https://www.nichifor.net/).

I do research in microeconomic theory, with a particular focus on aspects of **fairness** in **market design**.

I am on the **2024/2025 academic job market** and I am available for interviews.[^1]

<!-- You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
